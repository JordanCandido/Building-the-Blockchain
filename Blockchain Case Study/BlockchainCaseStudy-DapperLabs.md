# CASE STUDY OF Dapper Labs

## What is it: Overview and Origin

Dapper Labs is a consumer-focused Flow blockchain product that makes games and supports digital collectibles. Since it was founded in 2018, Dapper Labs has given consumer enthusiasts a real stake in the game by bringing them closer to the brands they love, enabling engaged and exciting communities for them to contribute to, and powering new pathways for them to become creators themselves. Dapper Labs builds products tailored to the user and ensures that items of value to you are decentralized. Dapper Labs calls themselves "The NFT Company". They have worked on products such as NBA TopShot, CyproKitties and CheezeWizards. The company is currently privately owned and has recently received $250M in funding through a Series D round.

## Why this matters: Business Activities

Blockchain is the biggest thing to happen to the internet since the iPhone. It will reshape how we use and interact with digital worlds. But for this technology to realize its real-world potential, it needs to, y’know, be used. By people. Real people, in the real world—not just industry insiders and early adopters.

## Why this may be interesting:

This company is spearheading a revolution that aims to take games, art, music and sports to a digital blockhain. Products including trading cards, video games, songs/music videos and digital art are made available to customers on their Flow blockchain. This may be interesting because this may be the first real attempt on furthering the digitization of collectibles and be the beginning of a revolution to a more technological world.
